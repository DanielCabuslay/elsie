# MyAnimeList Client: Elsie
Elsie is a web based MyAnimeList client. The goal of this project is to provide a Material Design client for MyAnimeList, allowing the user to search for anime and manga, and manage their Anime and Manga lists. Additional data from AniList is also fetched, such as upcoming episode times, external links to official sites and legal streaming locations, and links to videos and episodes (all when available from AniList).

Due to API restrictions, the user is required to their MyAnimeList account in order to use the client.

# MyAnimeList Client: Elsie
Elsie is a web based MyAnimeList client. The goal of this project is to provide a Material Design client for MyAnimeList, allowing the user to search for anime and manga, and manage their Anime and Managa lists. Due to API restrictions, the user is required to their MyAnimeList account in order to use the client.

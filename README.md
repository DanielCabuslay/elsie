Elsie is a [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) User List Client. The goal of this project is to provide a Material Design client for MyAnimeList, allowing the user to view their Anime and Manga lists. Additional data from [AniList](https://anilist.co/) is also fetched, such as upcoming episode times, external links to official sites and legal streaming locations.
